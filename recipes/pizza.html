        <h3>Steps to make Pizza</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Kneading the dough</li>
            <li>Cold fermenting</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Kneading the dough</h4>
            <p>1. First, take 2 bowls and add the amount of flour specified by the calculator to one of them.</p>
            <p>2. Fill the second bowl with the amount of water the calculator tells you to use. Make sure that the water is cold enough(anywhere between 12℃ / 53℉ and 19℃ / 66℉ will do).</p>
            <p>3. Add your salt (preferably kosher salt or sea salt), stir it into the water until it’s completely dissolved.</p>
            <p>Now it’s time to dissolve the yeast in the water, but there’s one big problem: Yeast doesn’t like salty water, as the salt will damage the yeast. Which means your dough won’t rise the way it’s supposed to.</p>
            <p>4. So, you take some of the flour from bowl number one (about 10%) and mix it into your salty water. You don’t have to be super accurate, but it is a very important step because the flour will protect the yeast against the salt, allowing it to do its job properly.</p>
            <p>5. Ok. When you’ve stirred the salt and 10% of the flour into your water, you can add your fresh yeast. If you don’t have fresh yeast, you can use dry yeast, but make sure to use half of the amount recommended by the calculator. (yes, it’s a tiny amount, but trust me, it works!) When the yeast is stirred into the salty, flowery water you can add the rest of the flour to it.</p>
            <p>6. Now all the ingredients are in the bowl, you can loosely mix them with a spoon or with your fingertips.</p>
            <p>7. When everything is mixed together, you can start kneading the dough until it has an even, soft and elastic consistency. This usually takes about 8 to 20 minutes of kneading.</p>
        
        <h4>Cold fermenting</h4>
            <p>1. After you knead the dough, you cover it with cling film or a damp towel and let it rest for 2 hours.</p>
            <p>2. After 2 hours have passed, you can portion the dough into balls (See the calculator to find out how large you should make your balls of dough)</p>
            <p>3. Cover the dough balls with cling film or a damp towel again and let them rise at room 18-21℃ temperature for 4-22 hours.</p>
            <p>4. Then make the pizzas.</p>
